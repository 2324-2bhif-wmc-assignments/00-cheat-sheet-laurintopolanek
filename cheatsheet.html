    <h1>Web and Basics</h1>

    <p>1. History about the World Wide Web</p>
    <ul>
        <li> invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN</li>
        <li>He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization</li>
        <li>He submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name. He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.</li>
