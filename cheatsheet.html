    <h1>Web and Basics</h1>

    <p>1. History about the World Wide Web</p>
    <ul>
        <li> invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN</li>
        <li>He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization</li>
        <li>He submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name. He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.</li>
        <li>The technology was reMosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server.[21][22] Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape the following year and released the Navigator browser, which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web.leased outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the whole Internet on 23 August 1991. The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions. Within the next two years, there were 50 websites created.</li>
        <li>CERN made the Web protocol and code available royalty free in 1993, enabling its widespread use.[17][18] After the NCSA released the Mosaic web browser later that year, the Web's popularity grew rapidly as thousands of websites sprang up in less than a year.</li>
        <li>Mosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server.[21][22] Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape the following year and released the Navigator browser, which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web.</li>
        <li>It quickly became the dominant browser. Netscape became a public company in 1995 which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.Microsoft responded by developing its own browser, Internet Explorer, starting the browser wars. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.</li>
        <li>Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricter XHTML.In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications anIn 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned X and in 2019, ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.</li>
