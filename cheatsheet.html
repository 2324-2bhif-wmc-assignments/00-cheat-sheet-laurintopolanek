      <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>1. History about the World Wide Web</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN</li>
        <li>He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization</li>
        <li>He submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name. He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.</li>
        <li>The technology was reMosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server. Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape the following year and released the Navigator browser, which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web. Leased outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the whole Internet on 23 August 1991. The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions. Within the next two years, there were 50 websites created.</li>
        <li>CERN made the Web protocol and code available royalty free in 1993, enabling its widespread use. After the NCSA released the Mosaic web browser later that year, the Web's popularity grew rapidly as thousands of websites sprang up in less than a year.</li>
        <li>Mosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server.</li>
        <li>It quickly became the dominant browser. Netscape became a public company in 1995 which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.Microsoft responded by developing its own browser, Internet Explorer, starting the browser wars. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.</li>
        <li>Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricter XHTML.In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications anIn 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned X and in 2019, ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. URL</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially known as an address on the Web, is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),although many people use the two terms interchangeably.</li>
        <li>URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (HTTP/HTTPS) but are also used for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.</li>
        <li>Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html). </li>
        <li>Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI. The URI generic syntax consists of five components organized hierarchically in order of decreasing significance from left to right.</li>
        <li>URI = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path ["?" query] ["#" fragment]</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Web Server</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>1. Overview</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.</li>
        <li>A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.</li>
        <li>A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.</li>
        <li>A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software.</li>
        <li>Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Web Client</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>1. Overview</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A web browser is an application for accessing websites.</li>
        <li>When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.</li>
        <li>Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser.</li>
        <li>The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%.</li>
        <li>Web Browser is not the same as a search engine.</li>
        <li>A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites.</li>
        <li>However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.</li>
        <li>In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents. </li>
        <li>In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents. </li>
        <li>User Agents: On the Web, a user agent is a software agent capable of and responThis includes all web browsers, such as Google Chrome and Safari.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Function of a Web Client</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web or from local storage and display it on a user's device.</li>
        <li>This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</li>
        <li>Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data.</li>
        <li>If the URL uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of communications security and information privacy.</li>
        <li>Website pages contains hyperlinks to  other pages/ressources.</li>
        <li>Each link contains a URL.</li>
        <li>Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page.</li>
        <li>The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again.</li>
        <li>Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.</li>
      </ul>
